  Step 1:
  create your Virtual Enviroment
Isolation: Virtual environments allow you to create isolated environments for each project, ensuring that the project's dependencies do not interfere with other projects or the system environment.
Dependency Management: With virtual environments, you can specify and manage the exact versions of libraries and packages required for your project, avoiding conflicts and ensuring reproducibility.
Portability: Virtual environments make it easy to share and distribute projects by including a requirements file that lists all dependencies. This ensures that others can recreate the exact environment needed to run the project.
Security: By keeping dependencies isolated within a virtual environment, you reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities and conflicts that may arise from installing packages system-wide.

Code:
conda create -p venv python 3.12.2 -y
Activated environment for .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe
select kernal for your virtual enviroment
